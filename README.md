# Calcu is the hand arms vibration calculator

Welcome to the Hand Arm Vibration Calculator!
This project is designed to help you calculate and assess the potential risks of hand-arm vibration exposure.
By providing information about the tool name, exposure duration, and result, this calculator will assist you in determining the vibration level
and ensuring the safetyand well-being of individuals using vibrating tools.

How TO USE

Tool Name: Enter the name or description of the vibrating tool being used.
This could be a power tool, machinery, or any equipment that produces vibrations.

Exposure Duration (minutes): Specify the amount of time, in minutes, that a person has been exposed to the vibrations from the tool.
This field helps in evaluating the overall exposure level.

Result: This field will display the calculated vibration level based on the tool name and exposure duration provided.
It gives an indication of the potential risk level associated with the hand-arm vibration exposure.

Calculate: After filling in the necessary information, click the "Calculate" button to compute the vibration level based on the input. 
The result will be displayed in the "Result" field.
